# Building and running the application

You can now build the project by using the **Build | Build Project ** menu entry, or the corresponding shortcut. This will produce an executable which can then be run
either from the IDE, by creating a [Run Configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html), or via the command line as so

```shell
./kotlin-hands-on-intro-kotlin-native.kexe https://kotlinlang.org

```

producing the output of the request to the console.
